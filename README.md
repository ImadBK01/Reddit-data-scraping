# Reddit-data-scraping
Two Python scripts designed for scraping data from Reddit.com:

**First Script:**
The objective is to gather comprehensive data about submissions in a specific subreddit, focusing on 'News' in this case.

**Second Script:**
The goal is to retrieve all available comments from a specified subreddit with user information and the timing, with a primary focus on the 'News' subreddit.
